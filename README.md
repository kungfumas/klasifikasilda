# Introduction

COVID-19 has impacted the world in a multitude of ways, one of the most wide-spread changes in the United States is the pandemic-prompted increase in remote learning.  

For my capstone project, I want to explore the question "What is the sentiment of COVID-19-prompted, remote learning in the United States?" Using data collected from Twitter, Natural Language Processing and Supervised Machine Learning, I created a text classifier to predict the sentiment (positive/negative) of Tweets on remote learning in the United States during 2020.

The Stakeholders for my project are educational entities (school boards, superintendents, school administrators and educators) and companies (education technology, internet providers) seeking to support students engaged in remote learning.


# Data Description
The data used in this project was collected from Twitter using [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy). A total of X tweets were collected, covering the dates X to Y and using the search filters X, Y, and Z.  Positive and Negative sentiment scores on the tweets were obtained with a hybrid approach of using [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) and [Text Blob](https://github.com/sloria/textblob) sentiment tools and human labeling.
